My studies fall under the following umbrellas:

* core math
* physics 
* core cs/algorithms
* ML/AI
* inference
* form and movement in complex systems (complexity, geometry)  

I am engaged in a multiple year nerd-up in these areas, as I prepare for greater service in ML/AI.  

This repo includes my study notes. Lit reviews can be found on my blog.
