I am engaged in a multiple year nerd-up in the following areas, as I move towards deeper service in collective cognition and emergence research, transportation planning, and machine intelligence engineering: 

* CS (command-line, Python, vim, data structures, SQL, algorithms)
* math (calculus, linear algebra, differential geometry)
* inference (classical, Bayesian) 
* ML/AI (supervised, Bayesian, reinforcement learning)
* agent-based modeling/swarm intelligence systems
* probabilistic/dynamic/stochastic programming
* complexity/graph/network theory (including agent based modeling)

This repo includes my course study notes and code. My study path and literature reviews are linked in the wiki.
