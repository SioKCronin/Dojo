I am engaged in a multiple year nerd-up in the following areas, as I move towards deeper service in data/computer science, collective cognition, and machine intelligence: 

* core CS (command-line, Python, vim, data structures, SQL, algorithms)
* core math (calculus, linear algebra)
* core inference (classical, Bayesian) 
* core ML/AI (supervised, Bayesian, reinforcement learning)
* probabilistic programming
* predictive modeling 
* complexity/graph/network theory
* differential geometry analysis of complex systems 
* third hemisphere cognition and BCI

This repo includes my course study notes and code. My study path and literature reviews are linked in the wiki.
