I am engaged in a multiple year nerd-up in the following areas, as I move towards deeper service in data science, computer programming, and machine intelligence research: 

* core CS (command-line, Python, vim, data structures, SQL, algorithms)
* classical and Bayesian inference 
* probabilistic programming
* predictive modeling 
* complexity/graph/network theory
* calculus and linear algebra
* differential geometry analysis of complex systems 

This repo includes my course study notes and code. My study path and literature reviews are linked in the wiki.
