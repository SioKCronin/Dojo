# Study

My studies are organized in the following umbrella arenas:

* philosopy of mind
* machine learning
* inference
* form and movement in complex systems  

I am presently engaged in a multiple year "nerd up" on foundational knowledge that undercuts all of these, including study of calculus, linear algebra, core computer science, dynamical systems, network theory, graph theory, and complexity theory. 

This repo includes my study notes. Literature reviews can be found on my blog.
