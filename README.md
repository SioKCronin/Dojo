I am engaged in a multiple year nerd-up in the following areas, as I move towards deeper service in computational intelligence and software engineering: 

* computer science 
* math (proofs, class notes)
* inference (classical, Bayesian) 
* ML/AI (supervised, Bayesian, reinforcement learning)
* soft computing (agent-based modeling, swarm intelligence) 
* probabilistic/dynamic/stochastic programming
* complexity/graph/network theory

My study path and literature reviews are linked in the wiki.
