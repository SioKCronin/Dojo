I am engaged in a multiple year nerd-up in the following areas, as I move towards deeper service in software engineering and complex systems research: 

* computer science (core)
* math
* inference/probability/statistics
* ML/AI (core)
* reinforcement learning
* swarm intelligence
* complexity/graph/network theory

My study path and literature reviews are linked in the wiki.
