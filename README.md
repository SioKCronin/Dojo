# Study

My studies are organized under the following umbrellas:

* philosopy of mind
* machine learning
* inference
* form and movement in complex systems  

I am engaged in a multiple year "nerd up" on foundational knowledge that undercuts my entire research program. This material includes study of calculus, linear algebra, differential geometry, core computer science, dynamical systems, network theory, graph theory, and complexity theory. 

This repo includes my study notes. Literature reviews can be found on my blog.
