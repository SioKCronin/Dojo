My studies fall under the following umbrellas:

* maths
* cs/algorithms
* ML/AI
* inference/stats
* complexity/network theory

I am engaged in a multiple year nerd-up in these areas, as I move towards deeper service in machine intelligence.  This repo includes my course study notes, and literature reviews can be found on my [blog](http://www.siobhankcronin.com/blog/).
