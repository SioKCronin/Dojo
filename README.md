My studies falll under the following umbrellas:

* philosopy of mind
* machine learning / deep learning 
* inference
* math / form and movement in nature 

I am engaged in a multiple year "nerd up" on foundational knowledge, as I prepare for greater service in AI and machine learning engineering. 

This material includes study of calculus, linear algebra, differential geometry, core computer science, dynamical systems, network theory, graph theory, and complexity theory. 

This repo includes my study notes. Lit reviews can be found on my blog.
