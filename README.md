My studies fall under the following umbrellas:

* geometry
* physics 
* CS
* ML/AI
* inference
* form and movement in complex systems  

I am engaged in a multiple year "nerd up" on foundational knowledge in these areas, as I prepare for greater service in AI and machine learning engineering. 

This repo includes my study notes, and lit reviews can be found on my blog.
