'''
Given a non-empty array containing only positive integers, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.
Note:
Each of the array element will not exceed 100.
The array size will not exceed 200.

Example 1:
Input: [1, 5, 11, 5]
Output: true
Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].

Example 2:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 5]
Output: false

Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.
Commentary: this is knapsack 0/1 problem in disguise.
