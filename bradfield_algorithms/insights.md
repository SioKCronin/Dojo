#General Strategy
* What is the relationship between the problem and the sub-problem?
* What are units of measurement for measuring system efficiency?
* What patterns can you see in the mapping of input to output?
* What is your brain computer doing in solving the problem?

# Coding insights

* Don't make a list if your just going to use an iterator once
* If you're passing to a function like sum, why not just use [generator](http://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/generators.html)?

# Specific problems

## Pangram
* I learned about string.ascci_lowercase and s.lower() for all i.isalpha()
did most of my heavy lifting
* We discussed a bitwise solution that I'd like to explore further

## Hamming
* Knowing True = 1 allows us to check all pairs by index and sum up the 
the ones that are different
* I got stuck getting my try-except ValueError raising to register, and 
wasn't sure what was happening there

## Difference of Squares
* This one was funny, because in writing up a list comprehension to make 
sure I understood what was being asked, I solved the problem. I cheated
but putting them right into the function, but it's the kind of problem I
feel I understand well.
